/**
 * @brief TRS-80 Model I terminal screen with character grid rendering and dual display support
 *
 * M1TerminalScreen provides a complete TRS-80 Model I terminal emulation with a 64x16
 * character grid display. It implements efficient incremental rendering, dual font support,
 * and split-screen viewing capabilities to authentically recreate the original TRS-80
 * terminal experience.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **64x16 Character Grid**: Full TRS-80 Model I display resolution
 * - **Incremental Rendering**: Only changed characters are redrawn for efficiency
 * - **Dual Buffer System**: Backing buffer + shadow buffer for change detection
 * - **Horizontal/Vertical Scrolling**: Arrow key navigation through 64-column display
 * - **Multiple Font Sets**: Switch between different character fonts
 * - **Pixel-Perfect Accuracy**: Authentic TRS-80 character rendering
 * - **Memory Efficient**: Uses differential updates to minimize redraw overhead
 *
 * ## Display Architecture
 *
 * ```
 * Full 64x16 Grid:           Scrollable View:
 * ┌─────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
 * │ Character Grid      │    │ Viewport (adaptive)  │
 * │ 64 columns          │ →  │ ← → H. Scrollable    │
 * │ 16 rows             │    │ ↑ ↓ V. Scrollable    │
 * │ 1024 total chars    │    │ Size: Content Area   │
 * └─────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘
 * ```
 *
 * ## Buffer Management
 *
 * The terminal uses a dual-buffer system for efficient rendering:
 * - **Backing Buffer**: `_bufferedVidMem[1024]` - Current character data
 * - **Shadow Buffer**: `_writtenVidMem[1024]` - Previously rendered characters
 * - **Change Detection**: Compares buffers to identify characters needing updates
 *
 * ## Memory Layout
 *
 * ```
 * Video Memory Layout (1024 bytes):
 * Row 0:  [0-63]   - Characters 0-63 (top row)
 * Row 1:  [64-127] - Characters 64-127
 * ...
 * Row 15: [960-1023] - Characters 960-1023 (bottom row)
 *
 * Index Calculation: index = (y * 64) + x
 * ```
 *
 * ## Performance Optimization
 *
 * - **Incremental Updates**: Only changed characters trigger pixel updates
 * - **Line-by-Line Rendering**: Characters updated one pixel line at a time
 * - **Differential Drawing**: Only modified pixels within characters are redrawn
 * - **Frame-Rate Control**: Updates distributed across multiple frames for smooth animation
 * - **Horizontal/Vertical Scrolling**: Arrow keys scroll viewport dynamically through 64-column
 * display based on content area width
 * - **Viewport Culling**: Only renders characters within visible display area
 *
 * ## Font System
 *
 * Supports multiple TRS-80 character sets:
 * - Standard ASCII characters
 * - TRS-80 specific graphics characters
 *
 * ## Model1 Integration
 *
 * The terminal can automatically load content from the Model1 system:
 * - Reads video memory from Model1 (0x3C00-0x3FFF) when test signal is active
 * - Syncs with actual TRS-80 Model I display state
 * - Falls back to demo pattern when Model1 is not available
 *
 * @see ContentScreen For base screen functionality
 * @see Screen For screen interface
